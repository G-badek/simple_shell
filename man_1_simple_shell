This is a simple UNIX command interpreter. Simple_shell is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file.

.SS Overview
A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.

.SS Path search
When type a command, the shell first looks to see if it has a builtin command with that name. If exist a coincidence in the PATH of the environment variable (env) with that name. Then append the command from the prompt to the PATH directory and return the entire path. If don't exist coincidence an error is displayed.
